# Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) Architectures and Transfer Learning for Robust Plant Seedlings Classification

Earlier computer vision methods employed for selective weeding have faced significant difficulties in achieving reliable and accurate weed identification. In this paper, several approaches and architectures to classify plant seedlings are proposed using a dataset containing around 5,000 images of 960 unique plants belonging to 12 species at various stages of growth. The purpose of this study is to develop and compare several classification techniques to predict the plant species. The classification methods include Custom LeNet with different optimizations, and Transfer Learning with VGG, Residual Networks (ResNet), Inception_V3, DenseNet, SqueezeNet and EfficientNet models. By comparing the results and performances of these models we achieved 95.26% validation accuracy and aimed to identify the best model suitable for this dataset. The study also focuses on the data processing, parameter tuning, and layer construction of CNN models to gain insights into the computer vision field.
